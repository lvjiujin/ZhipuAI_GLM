吕不韦（？—前235年），姜姓，吕氏。中国战国时代政治人物，卫国濮阳（今河南濮阳南）人[注 1]，初为大商人，后来成为秦相，封文信侯，在秦为相十三年。广招门客以“兼儒墨，合名法”为思想中心，合力编撰《吕氏春秋》，有系统性的提出自己的政治主张，后为先秦杂家代表人物之一[1]。
执政时曾攻取周、赵、卫的土地，立三川、太原、东郡，对秦王政兼并六国的事业有重大贡献。后因嫪毐集团叛乱事受牵连，被免除相邦职务，出居河南封地。不久，秦王政下令将其流放至蜀（今四川），不韦忧惧交加，于是在三川郡（今河南洛阳）自鸩而亡。

秦始皇（前259年2月18日—前210年7月11日[参1]），嬴姓，赵氏，名政，时称赵政（或称赵正），史书多作秦王政或始皇帝。 祖籍嬴城（今山东济南市莱芜区）[参2][参3][参4][参5]，生于赵国首都邯郸（今河北邯郸市），是秦庄襄王及赵姬之子[古4]，商朝重臣恶来的第35世孙。出土《北京大学藏西汉竹书》第三卷中称其为赵正。唐代司马贞在《史记索隐》引述《世本》称其为赵政[注4][参6]。曹植《文帝诔》最早称始皇帝为嬴政[参7]，后世通称嬴政，亦被某些文学作品称为“祖龙”[注5]。他是战国末期秦国君主，十三岁即位，先后铲除嫪毐与吕不韦，并重用李斯、尉缭，三十九岁时灭亡六国建立秦朝，自称“始皇帝”，五十岁出巡时驾崩[参8]，在位三十七年。
秦始皇是中国史上第一位使用“皇帝”称号的君主[参9]。统一天下后，秦始皇继承了商鞅变法的郡县制度和中央集权[参9]，统一度量衡，“车同轨，书同文，行同伦[参10]”及典章法制[参8]，奠定了中国政治史上两千馀年之专制政治格局，他被明代思想家李贽誉为“千古一帝”。但另一方面，秦始皇在位期间亦进行多项大型工程，包括修筑长城、阿房宫、骊山陵等，施政急躁，令人民徭役过重，是秦朝在他死后3年迅速灭亡的重要原因。
